# Etch-a-Sketch

Trying to make a Etch-a-sketch :P

- The web need a 16x16 grid of squares. ✅
- Change the background color of the squares with the mouse (hover, onClick).✅
- The user can change the width and height of the grid (max 100). ✅
- The user can change the color of the pencil. ✅
- Create a palette of basic colors.
- Create a option to randomize the color of the pencil.
- (Maybe) Add a way the user can change the size of the pencil.
- Add the style of the page (background, font, style of the btn, etc). ✅
